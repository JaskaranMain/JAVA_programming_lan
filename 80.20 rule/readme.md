The 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle) applies to Java, just like it does in many fields of learning and development. In Java programming:
<br><br>
<pre>-20% of Java concepts (core features like OOP, collections, exception handling, multithreading, and Spring Boot) are
used in 80% of real-world applications.<br>
-The remaining 80% of Java (like advanced concurrency, JavaFX, custom class loaders, RMI) is only needed in 20% of
niche cases.</pre><br>

<pre>The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle) for Java means focusing on the 20% of concepts that are used in 80% of real-world
java applications. This helps you quickly become proficient in Java without getting lost in rarely used features.

Hereâ€™s an 80/20 breakdown for Java:

Core Java (Must-Know - 20%)
âœ… Syntax & Basics â€“ Data types, variables, operators
âœ… Control Flow â€“ If-else, loops (for, while, do-while), switch
âœ… OOP Concepts â€“ Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
âœ… Collections Framework â€“ List, Set, Map, Queue
âœ… Exception Handling â€“ Try-catch, throws, finally, custom exceptions
âœ… Multithreading & Concurrency â€“ Threads, Runnable, ExecutorService
âœ… File Handling & I/O â€“ Reading/Writing files (BufferedReader, FileWriter)
âœ… JVM Internals â€“ Memory management, Garbage Collection

Advanced Java (Useful for Projects - 20%)
âœ… Streams & Functional Programming â€“ Lambda, Streams API, Method References
âœ… Java 8+ Features â€“ Optional, Functional Interfaces, CompletableFuture
âœ… Database Connectivity (JDBC & ORM) â€“ CRUD operations using JDBC, Hibernate
âœ… Spring Boot (Essential for Backend Development) â€“ REST APIs, Dependency Injection
âœ… Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito) â€“ Writing and testing Java applications

Less Frequent (80% of Time, Used 20%)
ðŸš« JavaFX / AWT / Swing â€“ UI-based Java apps are rare now
ðŸš« Low-Level Networking (Sockets, RMI) â€“ Used in specific use cases
ðŸš« Reflection & Bytecode Manipulation â€“ Advanced use cases
ðŸš« Custom Class Loaders & Security Managers â€“ Used in enterprise-level development
ðŸš« J2EE (Legacy Java EE components) â€“ Modern Spring Boot replaces many old Java EE patterns
